    "text": "What is Org Dataviz?\nData visualization is the communication of numeric information using graphic displays a skill, much like written & oral communication skills. Data visualization can also be art, designed to evoke a feeling or thought. Data visualization typically has two main functions: exploratory visualizations which reveal new patterns & relationships; explanatory visualizations evaluate hypotheses or aid decision-making. Not all data visualization is ODV.\nOrganizational data visualization is the production of visual displays of quantitative data to support organizational decision-making which aims to describe, explain, predict, and change human behavior at work. ODV is not just data visualization as in related technical fields like biology or operational business components like logistics since these focus on non-human behavior (e.g., animals in biology) or behaviors of non-human systems (e.g., supply chain bottlenecks in logistics). ODV is distinct from data art (e.g., reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful) in that the primary purpose of data art is to entertain or for purely aesthetic purposes ODV is ruthlessly useful and simple and should make decisions obvious to stakeholders.\nAnother important distinction is how the display of this data is designed to activate System I or System II thinking (Tversky and Kahneman (1974)). System I is fast, an automatic, whereas System II is slow and deliberate. Our ODV should focus on activating System I thinking, to quickly present an insight. Contrast this from an infographic you might see in a print newspaper, which is designed to be mulled over and viewed at length to reveal several insights with thoughtful consideration. While infographics can data visualization, this is less emphasized in ODV.\n\n\n\n\nTversky, Amos, and Daniel Kahneman. 1974. “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.” Science 185 (4157): 1124–31. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.185.4157.1124.",

Visual communication is becoming increasingly important in the workplace, and many important decisions rest on one simple visual tool for communicing quantiative information. Data visualization skills can make you a more competitive job applicant.\nODV requires a multidisplinary approach. First, borrowing from computer science, this course uses the R programming language as it’s focused on statistics and visualization. You should already have familiarity with this software and this course aims to enhance it to allow your work to be reproducible. Second, ODV borrows from graphic design. Design thinking allows us to empathize with our audience to ensure they understand the data presented to then which can aid their decision-making. This course will require you to capitilize on your knowledge of I-O psychology and psychological statistics and enhance them with programming and design skills.",

It’s one of the fundamental ways to highlight data.\nColor is also an important part of organizational or individual branding. Thinking about the ubiquity of Coca-Cola red or Pepsi blue.\nColor perception from evolutionary psychology foundation and then cultural enforcement which drives differences\n\n\n\n1.8.2 Color Theory\n\nColor Wheel: The primary colors are red, green, and blue because that’s what our eyes can see. Red, blue, yellow is additive color theory from paint pigment days and not really representative of how color works.\nColor Harmony\n\nColor harmony involves choosing colors that work well together and are pleasing to the eye. Common color harmony schemes include:\nComplementary Colors: Colors opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., red and green) that create high contrast and vibrant looks.\nAnalogous Colors: Colors next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue, blue-green, and green) that create serene and comfortable designs.\nTriadic Colors: Three colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (e.g., red, yellow, and blue) that offer balanced and vibrant combinations.\nSplit-Complementary Colors: A base color and the two colors adjacent to its complementary color, offering high contrast but less tension than complementary colors.\n\nColor Context: The perception of a color can change depending on its context. For instance, a color may appear different against various background colors. Understanding how colors interact and influence each other helps in creating effective visualizations.\n\n\n\n1.8.3 Color Psychology\n(I need to look into the research on this more before I teach it) Colors can evoke emotions and associations: - Red: Energy, urgency, passion. - Blue: Trust, calm, professionalism. - Green: Growth, health, tranquility. - Yellow: Happiness, attention, caution. - Purple: Luxury, creativity, wisdom. - Orange: Enthusiasm, warmth, caution. - Color Associations - Red - Negative Values: Red is often used to indicate negative values, losses, or decreases. - Errors and Alerts: Red can signify errors, warnings, or urgent issues that need immediate attention. (there’s research on this, the red pen effect) - Critical States: In status indicators, red often represents critical conditions or failures. - Green - Positive Values: Green is commonly associated with positive values, gains, or increases. - Success and Approval: Green can indicate success, completion, or approval. - Safe and Normal States: In status indicators, green represents safe, normal, or optimal conditions. - Yellow - Caution: Yellow often signifies caution, warnings, or conditions that require attention but are not yet critical. - Intermediate Values: Yellow can be used for intermediate values between positive (green) and negative (red) extremes. - Blue - Neutral: Blue is often used as a neutral color to represent general information, averages, or non-critical data. - Information and Support: Blue can indicate informational messages or support functions. - Orange - Warning: Orange is used to indicate warnings or issues that are of moderate concern. - Pending Actions: It can also represent pending actions or items that are in progress. - Color Usage: Using color effectively in data visualization helps in communicating information clearly: - Highlighting Important Data: Use bold or contrasting colors to emphasize key data points. - Grouping Data: Use similar colors to group related data, making patterns and relationships easier to identify. - Sequential Data: Use gradient scales (light to dark) to represent sequential data, indicating progression or intensity. - Diverging Data: Use two contrasting colors to show deviation from a central point, often used in heat maps or to show differences.\nPeople sometimes want you to avoid red because it can be seen as intimidating or people might get defensive.

    "text": "2.1.1 Slope Plots\nSlope plots are useful for showing changes over time for categorical events with only two time points. The focus on only two time points should be naturally occuring, meaning you shouldn’t cherry pick just two time points to highlight changes over time if there are more time points available.\nThese slope plots capitalize on the evolution of the human visual system, namely, that our eyes have evolved to quickly detect differences in slopes as movement from predators. We can quickly glean angular directionality, that is, if a slope is increasing from the bottom left to the top right or vice versa. Slope plots allow your reader to quickly see which things have increased between the two time points and which have decreased.\nTake a look at this example comparing meta-analytic validity estimates of different individual difference selection assessments as reported by the classic Schmidt and Hunter (1998) study and the more recent Sackett et al. (2022) study. These validity estimates are the correlation between the assessement and job performance. You can quickly detect that nearly all of the estimates were revised down, with the exception of structured interviews and vocational interests which were slightly revised up between these two seminal studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1\n\n\n\nToo many categories quickly clutter slope plots. We can still capitalize on the angular directionality detection by breaking up slope plots using faceting. The {gt} tables package has options for sparklines that are pretty good to acheive this, but I prefer to create the plot myself. Essentially this becomes a table of slope plots, even though tables aren’t data visualization, they can become one if they contain many data visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2\n\n\n\nResources\n\nSlope plot code: ajthurston.com/slope\nhttps://seeingdata.org/taketime/inside-the-chart-slope-graph/\nhttps://datavizproject.com/data-type/slope-chart/",

These are charts that misrepresent data, leading to incorrect conclusions. They can be intentionally deceptive or result from errors in data handling or graph construction. Common methods of creating misleading graphs include truncating axes, improper scaling, using 3D effects, omitting data, and biased labeling. These practices can distort data interpretation, making small differences appear significant or large differences appear minor. To avoid misleading graphs, strategies include clear labeling, appropriate scaling, and avoiding unnecessary complexity. Proper data visualization aims to present data accurately without manipulation, ensuring the audience can interpret the information correctly.\nHow to make figures and presentations friendly to colorblind people: https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/\nModern data viz in R: https://pyoflife.com/modern-data-visualization-with-r/\nDataviz with R course: https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-visualization-with-r#about-course\nMultiple courses: https://www.datavis.ca/courses/\nCharts to make sense of 2024 from HBR: https://archive.ph/EJy0O\nNYT: From Inflation to Bitcoin, 9 Charts That Explain 2024: archived link",
