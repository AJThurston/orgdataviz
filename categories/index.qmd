## Frequencies

### Barplots
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
dat <- read.csv(here::here("data/validation.csv"), header = T)

ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = male, y = lapr)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", 
            stat = "summary", 
            fun = "mean")
```

- Also lollipop charts

### Density Plot

-   Demonstrating amounts (e.g., frequencies, distributions bar charts)
    -   Bar charts, loading bar chart as whitespace is information as well
    -   Communicating the lack of results is just as important as communicating the presence of results. Audiences are predispositioned to want to look for differences, but you must help them understand the MANIFOLD of differences, the larger context, that while there may be 2 differences among 10, the other 8 are not. You'd be surprised how often you need to state this explicitly.


### Icon array

Icon arrays are useful alternatives to bar plots because they are empirically better understood by non-technical audiences [@zhang2018].

### Jitterplot

## Descriptives Statistics

### Barplot

### Box and Whisker Plot

-   Visualization of descriptive statistics and distributions
-   Visualization of IQRs with density and quantiles overlaid

## Parts of a Whole

### Pie Charts

Do not make pie charts. They are very common but difficult to resolve as our brains struggle with how to resolve circles and are not adept at determining length from circumference.

The video below shows just how difficult it is to estimate the length of a circumference using a friendly bar trick. See if you can bet which is longer before watching the video: the height of the glass, including the elevated height of decks of cards, or just the circumference of the glass in this demonstration:

If you're asked to make a pie chart, please show this video to your boss or whoever asked you to make the pie chart. You, too, can join the good fight against pie charts.

Another issue is that pie charts are essentially area charts.

### Area Charts
- Area charts are unclear, use quantile charts instead: https://bsky.app/profile/dhmontgomery.com/post/3lgbbipumyv2m
- Also referred to as "mosiac charts", "treemaps", and "eikosograms" for join probabilities
