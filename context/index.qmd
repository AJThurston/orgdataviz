## Words Matter(?)
The language used to describe the data matters

- How to communicate statistical concepts without sounding like a robot: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morgandepenbusch_data-analyst-cheat-sheet-ugcPost-7275556209892446210-6Ilu/

Probabilistic language can mislead. In People v. Collins (1968), a California couple was convicted of robbery based largely on probabilistic evidence. The prosecution introduced statistical testimony suggesting that the chance of another couple matching the defendants' physical description was 1 in 12 million. This calculation was based on multiplying assumed probabilities of various traits (e.g., a black man with a beard and a white woman with a blond ponytail driving a yellow car). The court ruled that this statistical evidence was improperly presented and lacked a scientific basis. The conviction was overturned due to the misuse of probability, highlighting the dangers of applying flawed statistical reasoning in criminal trials.

- Data visualization isn't just about you visualizing your data but understanding and evaluating other people's visual presentation of data (or sniffing out bad dataviz bullshit)
