Welcome to Dr. [AJ Thurston](https://ajthurston.com)'s course on Organizational Data Visualization (ODV) as a part of the [George Mason University Industrial and Organizational Psychology program](https://io.gmu.edu). This course is focused on students in our Masters of Professional Studies (MPS) in I-O program, specifically, and is part of the newly established interdisciplinary certificate in data science. ODV is designed to train students to communicating quantitative information clearly, concisely, and convincingly to organizational stakeholders. Visual communication is increasingly important in the workplace, making ODV an increasingly valuable skill for both organizations and individuals.

## Prerequisites

This course requires a graduate level understanding of psychological statistics and a basic understanding of working with R and the {ggplot2} R package in particular. Specifically, students should have already completed PSYC 601: Applied Data Analysis in Psychology 1 or expressed written approval from the instructor in advance of the course.

Students are encouraged to have already installed R, R Studio, Positron, Quarto, and Github. This course from Microsoft is recommended to build basic familiarity with R, the {tidyverse} and {ggplot2} R packages:

- [Microsoft: Explore and analyze data with R (1 hour)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-analyze-data-with-r/)

Students are encouraged to maintain their code on Github and to familiarize themselves with version control (e.g., git).

## Textbook

The following textbook is required for the course:

[Yau, N. (2024). *Visualize This: The flowingdata guide to design, visualization, and statistics second edition*. John Wiley and Sons.](https://www.amazon.com/Visualize-This-FlowingData-Visualization-Statistics-dp-1394214863/dp/1394214863)

## What is Org Dataviz?

Data visualization is the communication of numeric information using graphic displays a skill, much like written & oral communication skills. Data visualization can also be art, designed to evoke a feeling or thought. Data visualization typically has two main functions: exploratory visualizations which reveal new patterns & relationships; explanatory visualizations evaluate hypotheses or aid decision-making. Not all data visualization is ODV.

Organizational data visualization is the production of visual displays of quantitative data to support organizational decision-making which aims to describe, explain, predict, and change human behavior at work. ODV is not just data visualization as in related technical fields like biology or operational business components like logistics since these focus on non-human behavior (e.g., animals in biology) or behaviors of non-human systems (e.g., supply chain bottlenecks in logistics). ODV is distinct from data art (e.g., reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful) in that the primary purpose of data art is to entertain or for purely aesthetic purposes ODV is ruthlessly useful and simple and should make decisions obvious to stakeholders.

Another important distinction is how the display of this data is designed to activate System I or System II thinking (@tversky1974). System I is fast, an automatic, whereas System II is slow and deliberate. Our ODV should focus on activating System I thinking, to quickly present an insight. Contrast this from an infographic you might see in a print newspaper, which is designed to be mulled over and viewed at length to reveal several insights with thoughtful consideration. While infographics can data visualization, this is less emphasized in ODV.
