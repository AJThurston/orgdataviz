# Interactive Visualization

- Exposure to PowerBI, datawrappers, and advanced programming (e.g., D3.js)
- Hosting interactive tools (e.g., Github Pages, Netlify)
- Serverless apps with shiny live: [https://youtu.be/RcwvG7dtMqU](https://youtu.be/RcwvG7dtMqU)
- Automation of Quarto and Github pages: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arzBRW5XIkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arzBRW5XIkg)
- Learn D3.js: [Data Visualization using r2D3: R Interface to D3 Visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjI7QbPPGFs)
- [An introduction to d3.js in 10 basic examples](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/intro_d3js.html
- I don't know if D3.js is all that worth it for a little bit of interactivity/animation

### Dashboards

- Interactive dashboards/minimum via products using R Shiny

- Scrollytelling R package: https://closeread.dev

### Animations

- Donâ€™t have animations playing in the background of your talks as our eyes are drawn to movement
- Using gganimate for animated data visualizations
- gganimate does not play nice with expression()
- Scrollytelling (closeread.dev) is an animation of sorts

	- "Data is often better than you think"
	- "The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data"
	- "If you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. That's dangerous to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries."
	- "The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized"
