## Courses

-   UC Berkley: Visualization enhances exploratory analysis as well as efficient communication of data results. This course focuses on the design of visual representations of data in order to discover patterns, answer questions, convey findings, drive decisions, and provide persuasive evidence. The goal is to give you the practical knowledge you need to create effective tools for both exploring and explaining your data. Exercises throughout the course provide a hands-on experience using relevant programming libraries and software tools to apply research and design concepts learned.

## Glossary

-   Data visualization is the practice of communicating quantitative information through visual means. It's goal is to take detailed individual or aggregate data to identify trends, group differences, and relationships among data to make the most salient findings readily accessible to technical and non-technical audiences alike. Data tables are not data visualization as they do not summarize data they simply present it.
-   Organizational data visualization is communicating quantitative information visually for the purposes of aiding in work-related decision-making.
-   This is contrasted from data art, which is the creation of aesthetically enjoyable data displays principally for their novelty or enjoyment.

-   Visualizing only inferential uncertainty, compared to outcome variability, can result in significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts (Zhang, et al., 2023). Inferential uncertainty (how precisely a statistic is estimated) and outcome variability (how much individual outcomes differ). This confusion can lead to an "illusion of predictability," where people overestimate the certainty and significance of scientific findings.

-   It would be tough to visualize a latent state–trait model with multiple indicators and autoregression across four measurement occasions in a simple, succinct, and “beautiful” way. Instead, the best visuals, in terms of effectively communicating and persuading the audience, focus on not much more than means (e.g., bar charts), variances (e.g., scatterplots), and groupings (e.g., social networks) (Ahmad & Zhou)
-   To form positive judgments of numerical information, people must be able to evaluate the “goodness” of a number (Voss & Lake, 2020)

-   Misleading graphs are another crucial topic in data visualization. These are charts that misrepresent data, leading to incorrect conclusions. They can be intentionally deceptive or result from errors in data handling or graph construction. Common methods of creating misleading graphs include truncating axes, improper scaling, using 3D effects, omitting data, and biased labeling. These practices can distort data interpretation, making small differences appear significant or large differences appear minor. To avoid misleading graphs, strategies include clear labeling, appropriate scaling, and avoiding unnecessary complexity. Proper data visualization aims to present data accurately without manipulation, ensuring the audience can interpret the information correctly.
