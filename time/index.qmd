# Visualizing Time

## Continuous Events

### Line charts

### Area charts

-   Changes over time as ratios: Month over month (MoM), year over year (YoY), etc.
    -   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
-   Representing cycles and seasonality (seasonal plots, decomposition plots).

## Categorical Events

## Waffleplot
- Visualization of events
- I recommend for categorical only actually)
    -   <https://vuorre.com/posts/2016-03-24-github-waffle-plot/>
    -   Cols: months, rows: days
    -   Memento mori plot with 80 years of months

        -   This one is "bad" because I don't need it broken out by state if the cases do not meaningfully differ by state
        -   I also prefer to use line charts for continuous data on the y-axis
        -   If necessary I would do line charts as facets for each state
        -   Sinar (2018) suggested length and angle more accurate than color contrast, saturation, or hue in interpretative accuracy 

## Communicating uncertainty
    -   538 has a cool way of showing uncertainty "95% of people fall in this band"

## Rank Order Changes

### Gantt Charts

### Survival Analysis

### Alluvial Diagrams
-   Visualization of events (e.g., Gantt charts, survival analysis charts).
-   Alluvial diagrams

### Bump Plot
-   Bump plot for rank order changes over time

## Forecasting
- There was a SIOP 2024 talk I attended on this?

- Visualization of seasonality using births, but make something like this but for accidents at work to demonstrate seasonality
