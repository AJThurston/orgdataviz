## Data

Note, your data must either be reproduced entirely here (e.g., written in a code cell as below) or it must be publicly available in a CSV format with a codebook (e.g., [ajthurston.com/validation](https://www.ajthurston.com))

```{r data}
dat <- data.frame(
  year = c(1972, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982),
  millions = c(50, 75, 125, 175, 225, 300)
)
```

## Plot

You must provide your own, original plot. Refer to the syllabus with respect to the difference between acceptable and exceptional performance with your plots.

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = year, y = millions)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    theme_minimal()
```
